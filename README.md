BT Storm is a NodeJS implementation of a web API framework built in TypeScript. It is used for both personal and professional work. Which is the only reason why it is published to NPM (to take advantage of semvar).

At this time, I don't plan on providing support outside of my own needs, so there is no documentation, and the underlying API may drastically without notice.

With that being said, the framework is available on NPM at BT Storm and can be used at your own risk. You will need to inspect the sources yourself.
